## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository automates every step of a causal analysis workflow:

1. **Data ingestion & feature engineering** (lags, pre-policy means)  
2. **Causal estimations** via DiD, PSM, and BSTS  
3. **Result verification** and validation tests  
4. **Figure & HTML report generation** for clean outputs  

The pipeline is fully automated from raw data â†’ verified results â†’ publication-ready report.
